**ReferPay.org** is a revolutionary project to build a true decentralized network, fully owned by 100,000 founding partners, aimed at building an open digital economy for everyone.

## üèõÔ∏è The Project's Constitution: The 100,000 Model

ReferPay.org is not just an application; it's a movement to build a new digital infrastructure owned by the community. Our model is based on a simple and powerful rule: **the power of numbers**.

* **The Goal:** To gather **100,000 founding partners**. Each partner is a cornerstone of the network.
* **The Infrastructure:** Our goal is to run services and applications on a network of **100,000 devices (IP addresses)** belonging to the partners, creating a truly distributed network resistant to central control.
* **Security:** The main platform treasury will be protected by a collective security system based on the **100,000 partner wallets**, providing unprecedented decentralized protection.
* **Funding:** The project's capital is built through a simple and symbolic contribution of **$5 (USDC)** from each partner. This gathers an initial seed fund of **$500,000** to build and develop the ecosystem.
* **Growth & Team Selection:** **$100,000** of the capital is allocated to the referral system. This system is not just for growth but is also a mechanism to test the competency of contributors. Through it, the best **100 leaders, developers, and marketers** will be selected to lead the advanced stages of the project based on their actual contributions.

## üí° The Core Feature: The Instant Growth Engine

The referral system is integrated directly into the smart contract and is **instantly activated** for every new partner.

* **How it Works:** As soon as a person contributes and becomes a partner (receives the partnership NFT), their ability to generate a unique referral link is **instantly activated**. The referral link will have the format: `Referpay.org?ref=ADDRESS`, where `ADDRESS` is the partner's wallet address.
* **The Direct Reward:** When this partner shares their link and invites a new person who joins with the $5 contribution, the original partner receives **$1 (USDC) instantly and directly** to their wallet. This process is fully automated by the smart contract.
* **Why it Matters:** This turns every partner, from the first moment they join, into an active contributor to the network's growth and ensures that value is distributed to community members instead of being spent on centralized advertising.
